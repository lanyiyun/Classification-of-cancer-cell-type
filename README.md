# Classification-of-cancer-cell-type

The task is to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), 
given a set of attributes about the cell. 


The data is with the format of:
1. Sample code number: id number 
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10 
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
